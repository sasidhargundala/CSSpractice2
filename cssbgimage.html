	<p>n 1948, Claude Shannon published "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", 
        an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the Bell System Technical Journal. 
        This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the information a sender wants to transmit. 
        In this fundamental work he used tools in probability theory, developed by Norbert Wiener, 
        which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time.
         Shannon developed information entropy as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing 
         the field of information theory.
         The binary Golay code was developed in 1949</p><br>
